# Count API Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## To Run Locally:

If using unzipped file submitted, you will have to run npm instal first to download the node modules.

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## To Build for Deploy

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Future Updates

Given that this API has many endpoints, a cool feature to add would be the stats data. Further we could use the library React-Query to to ensure the most up to date data on the number of hits instead of only updating when the button is clicked.
